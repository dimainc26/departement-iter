# Departement ITER - PHP 
## ITER

In the context of a project for the ITER university, I started developing a website using PHP, which offers the possibility to view information about the university, register and log in as a student or professor. Once authenticated, students have exclusive access to the student forum, creating a dedicated exchange and discussion platform. The innovative approach adopted for data management is interesting: instead of relying on a database, I opted for the use of directories and files to store user information and forum contents. This choice represented a significant challenge, requiring careful design to ensure security and efficiency in data access. The experience allowed me to deepen my PHP skills and explore alternative methods of data management, highlighting my ability to adapt and innovate in web development. The project demonstrated the importance of flexibility and creativity in solving technical problems, offering users a functional and intuitive experience without the use of a traditional database.
